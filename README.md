## Julia for Tensor Computations

This repository contains materials for a SIAM @ UIUC workshop on implementing tensor computations in Julia, using the ITensor library. The goal is to introduce basic tensor operations, tensor decompositions, and applications in quantum physics and machine learning in approximately 1 - 1.5 hours.

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Julia and Julia-specific operations
- Basics of tensors, Einstein summation, tensor contractions, and network diagrams
- The ITensor library: creating tensors, performing operations, and visualizing tensor networks
- Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Trains: representation, decomposition, and applications
- Applications in quantum physics: simulating quantum states and operators
- Applications in machine learning: supervised learning with tensor networks
